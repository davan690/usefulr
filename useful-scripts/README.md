### ./useful-scripts/

This folder includes simple tasks wrapped into individual R scripts. Some of these documents will develop into vignettes made with `.Rmd` files which belong in the `RMarkdown-vignettes` folder. These scripts should not be regarded as functions yet either but as the scripts that I use all the time become more accesses I will turn them into stand-alone packages.
