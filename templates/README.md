*These documents are likely to be moved to the [reproducible guide]() I am developing on GIT.*

Currently this folder contains simple templates I am currently developing for ecological publications. There are many different templates available and templates are vital for truely reproducible workflows. I will continue to develop these templates in the reproducible guide that I am developing from the [BES guidebook for reproducible code](). Currently:

- [simple manuscript template]()

- [information based blog template]()
